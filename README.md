## Data Wrangling and EDA:
1. [Data Analysis of the “War of the Five Kings”](https://github.com/YX-SYD/Data-Wrangling-Visulization/blob/master/war-of-five-kings/Game_of_thrones_battle_analysis.ipynb) - Game of Thrones.  
Through extensive EDA, following questions are answered:  
- Which year has the most battles?
- Which region sees the largest number of battles?
- Which king attacks most? Which king wins the most battles as an attacker?
- Which battle type is more common?What battle styles are used by each attacker king.
- The impact of army size.
- The impact of season.
- How many commanders are owned by each attacker king?
- Which commander leads most battles as an attacker commander?Who are the commanders with the most victories of each attacker king?
Does the major house fight alone or with allies in attacker side?

## Statistical Analysis
1. [Mobile Games A/B Testing with Cookie Cats](https://github.com/YX-SYD/DataCamp-Mini-projects/blob/master/Mobile%20Games%20AB%20Testing%20with%20Cookie%20Cats.ipynb)  
In a puzzle game, players will occasionally encounter gates that force them to wait a non-trivial amount of time or make an in-app purchase to progress. In addition to driving in-app purchases, these gates serve the important purpose of giving players an enforced break from playing the game, hopefully resulting in that the player's enjoyment of the game being increased and prolonged. But where should the gates be placed? Initially the first gate was placed at level 30, but in this notebook we're going to analyze an AB-test where we moved the first gate in Cookie Cats from level 30 to level 40. In particular, we will look at the impact on player retention.  

2. [Risk and Returns The Sharpe Ratio](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/datacamp/Risk%20and%20Returns_%20The%20Sharpe%20Ratio/project/Risk%20and%20Returns_%20The%20Sharpe%20Ratio/Risk%20and%20Returns%20The%20Sharpe%20Ratio.ipynb#)  
The Sharpe ratio has been one of the most popular risk/return measures in finance, not least because it's so simple to use. It also helped that Professor Sharpe won a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1990 for his work on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). In this project, the Sharpe ratio is calculated for the stocks of the two tech giants Facebook and Amazon. As a benchmark, we'll use the S&P 500 that measures the performance of the 500 largest stocks in the US.

3. [Analyzing the Stroop Effect](https://github.com/YX-SYD/Udacity_Advanced_Data_Analyst/blob/master/Test%20a%20Perceptual%20Phenomenon.ipynb)  
In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participant’s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. In this project, we use one-side t-test to evaluate the time consumed for reading the words in  congruent words and incongruent words conditions.
